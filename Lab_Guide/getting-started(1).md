# Power BI Embedded Hands On Lab

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 hours

## Overview

Power BI Embedded enables you to seamlessly integrate interactive Power BI reports and dashboards into your applications, providing rich data visualization experiences for your users. With capabilities to create, embed, and customize Power BI content, this service helps organizations enhance decision-making processes and deliver actionable insights. By leveraging Power BI Embedded, you can enable scalable, secure, and cost-effective analytics solutions tailored to your business needs, fostering innovation and improving operational efficiency.

## Objective

This lab is designed to equip participants with hands-on experience in leveraging Power BI Embedded to integrate and customize data visualizations within applications, providing scalable and interactive reporting solutions.

- **Power BI Embedded Workshop Guide:** Implement Power BI Embedded to embed reports and dashboards into custom applications. Configure access and manage authentication for seamless integration.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have the following prerequisites:

- **Basic Understanding of Power BI**: Familiarity with Power BI concepts, including creating reports and dashboards.
- **Experience with Azure Portal**: Ability to navigate and manage Azure resources via the Azure Portal.
- **Knowledge of Power BI Service**: Understanding of how to publish and manage Power BI reports in the Power BI Service.
- **Basic Programming Knowledge**: Familiarity with programming or scripting languages (such as JavaScript or C#) to interact with Power BI Embedded APIs for embedding reports into applications.
- **Familiarity with APIs**: Understanding of how to use REST APIs for embedding Power BI content into applications.

## Architechture

The architecture for integrating **Power BI Embedded** into applications involves using the **Power BI Embedded** service, which allows embedding **Power BI** reports and dashboards within your application. The reports are created and stored in the **Power BI service**, and authentication is managed via **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** to ensure secure access. A client application communicates with **Power BI** using the **Power BI REST API** to embed reports and handle user interactions. The application displays these reports seamlessly, enabling users to explore and interact with the embedded data. This architecture leverages **Azure's cloud capabilities** to deliver scalable, interactive data visualizations within custom applications.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves several key components:

- **Power BI Embedded Service**: Allows the integration of Power BI reports and dashboards into custom applications, enabling users to view interactive reports directly within the app.
- **Power BI Reports and Dashboards**: The visualizations and data insights created in Power BI that can be embedded into external applications.
- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: Provides identity and access management, ensuring secure authentication and authorization for Power BI Embedded users.
- **Power BI REST API**: A set of web services that allows developers to interact with Power BI resources, enabling the embedding of reports, management of user access, and more.
- **Power BI Workspace**: A container within Power BI for organizing and managing reports and datasets, which can be shared or embedded into other applications.
